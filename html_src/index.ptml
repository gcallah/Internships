        <h3>
        Internship Policies and Guidelines
        </h3>

    <p>
        Undergraduate internship courses are designated by CP-UY.
    </p>

    <p>
        These courses provide an opportunity for full-time students to pursue
        internship and work experiences in their fields of study that enhance
        and augment classroom learning, while also enhancing the overall
        educational experience by obtaining practical experience.
    </p>

    <h4>
    Eligibility and Requirements: Students
    </h4>

    <p>
        F-1 international students are required to complete at least two
        semesters of full-time study in the United States (U.S.) to be eligible
        for internship authorization. This may include time spent studying at
        another U.S. institution, including completion of a bachelor’s degree
        immediately prior to studying at NYU.  Please contact the Office of
        Global Services for details on F-1 internship eligibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        Undergraduate students must have a GPA of at least 2.50, as reflected
        on their academic transcript. Students cannot enroll in CP courses if
        they have an incomplete grade in any course from a prior semester.
        Students cannot enroll in a subsequent CP course if they have an
        Incomplete or a Fail grade from a previous CP course.
    </p>

    <h4>
    Eligibility and Requirements: Work Experiences
    </h4>

    <p>
        During the academic year, work experiences must be at least 12 weeks
        long. During the summer, they must be at least 8 weeks long.
        Additionally, the work experience must be a minimum of 240 hours. Start
        and end dates need not coincide with the first and last day of the
        semester, but must fit within the semester in order to ensure that
        final reports may be submitted and grades may be submitted in a timely
        manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the academic year, students cannot work more than 20 hours per
        week while classes are in session. Students who are in their final
        semester of study and who require, and are registered for, no more than
        3 credits (in addition to internship credits) may be approved to work
        40 hours per week. During the summer, students are permitted to work
        full-time, provided that they are not also taking more than 3 credits.
        Work hours must be consistent with the organization’s regular work
        schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
        Work experiences must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act
        (www.dol.gov/whd/flsa). As such, students must be paid at least minimum
        wage unless specific exceptions apply. The Department of Labor outlines
        a six-point test (www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm)
        regarding unpaid internships. Employers should consult their legal
        counsel for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
        Students must be hired as employees of the participating organization
        and must be paid directly by the organization using a W-2 form.
        Employers cannot pay students as independent contractors using an IRS
        1099 form.
    </p>

    <p>
        Employers must agree to assign a responsible, ranking employee as the
        student’s supervisor. This individual will provide appropriate
        supervision and mentoring, including establishing clear goals and
        expectations regarding tasks and projects. Employers must be willing to
        submit written midterm and final evaluations of the student’s work.
        Experiences will not be approved for companies that are not permitted
        to submit written evaluations. Employer supervisors must review the
        student’s final report so that proprietary and/or confidential
        information can be removed.
    </p>

<h4>
Procedures
</h4>

    <p>
        Students must obtain an offer letter on organization letterhead,
        or from a company email address, from
        the prospective employer. This letter must identify the company, its
        address, contact information, the student’s job title, and start and
        end dates of the internship.
    </p>

    <p>
        Students must update their placement information through their NYU
        CareerNet account Profile, per instructions provided by the Wasserman
        Center for Career Development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prospective employers send the advisor a detailed job description.
    </p>

    <p>
        Students will submit their offer letter, job description,
        and printed NYU CareerNet Profile to their departmental adviser who
        will identify a suitable faculty adviser. The faculty adviser will be
        responsible for all academic matters related to the work experience.
        The faculty adviser will evaluate the relevancy of the work experience
        and, if approved, will direct the student to register for the
        appropriate CP course.
    </p>

    <p>
        For approved International Students, the faculty adviser will provide
        the Office of Global Scholars (OGS) with all relevant information in
        order to process work authorization. International Students cannot
        begin working until they have received work authorization.
    </p>

    <p>
        The company supervisor must provide a mid-term evaluation and a final
        evaluation to the faculty supervisor. The student will submit a project
        report at the end of the term. Some departments or programs may also
        require a presentation. The report (and presentation, if required) will
        be included as a part of the assessment for the student’s grade.
        Faculty advisers will provide guidelines for the reports. All CP
        courses will be graded as Pass (P) or Fail (F).
    </p>

    <p>
        With the faculty adviser’s approval, consecutive work experiences may
        be completed with the same employer. Students must complete the same
        registration process and follow all procedures for re-applying and
        enrolling in another CP course. International Students must obtain
        prior permission from OGS for every period of employment. Students are
        not authorized to work during the interim period between the end of
        their prior CPT and the beginning of their next even if they will have
        an internship with the same company; this jeopardizes their visa
        status.
